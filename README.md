## Introduction

Care Protect is a web/mobile application which provides dashboards and assessment tools to detect and manage acute deterioration in residents and patients in care settings; it facilitates a safe shift in care to the care setting, recording both clinical and non clinical assessments using the ISBAR communication tool. Additionally, 

- Carer concern (DENWIS)
- NEWS2 assessments and monitoring
- SEPSIS screening

Additionally, Care Protect provides COVID19 management tools; 

- COVID19 assessment
- Detailed COVID19 status indicators

This repository contains the middlware for use with the Care Protect product. It provides basic [openEHR](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/care-protect-openEHR) composition submission via templates, non-blocking functionality with Perl Object Environment (POE) and an API (prototype) with CORS headers usable by the associated front end application [care-protect-ui](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/care-protect-ui).

**Attention! The application is at an early stage of development. We kindly ask for your understanding if something "doesn't work" but please raise any bugs or issues [here](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/care-protect-middleware/issues) . New changes and updates appear every day.**
